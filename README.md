# Hospital-Networking-Management-System-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-
Project Overview <br>
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Local Area Network (LAN) for a multi-floor hospital using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT). The hotel's network infrastructure comprises three floors: the ground floor, first floor, and second floor, each containing rooms with specific purposes. The network elements, including PCs, IP phones, and printers, are interconnected through switches, and all switches are further linked with a common router that provides connectivity on each floor. Proper IP addressing has been configured for each sector of the network, ensuring seamless communication and optimal functionality. The entire network setup is virtually simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT), leveraging the technology of Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).

The hospital departments are distributed floor-wise, and each department is isolated using VLANs for security and traffic management. Routers and switches form the backbone of the network, while end devices (PCs, IP Phones, and printers) are connected to each VLAN. The network is designed to be scalable, modular, and secure, making it suitable for real enterprise environments.
