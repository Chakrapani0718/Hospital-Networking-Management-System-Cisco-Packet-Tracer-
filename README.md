# Hospital-Networking-Management-System-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-
Project Overview <br>
This project focuses on building a Hospital Networking Management System in Cisco Packet Tracer. The design simulates a real-world hospital network infrastructure across three floors, ensuring reliable connectivity, secure communication, and efficient resource sharing.

The hospital departments are distributed floor-wise, and each department is isolated using VLANs for security and traffic management. Routers and switches form the backbone of the network, while end devices (PCs, IP Phones, and printers) are connected to each VLAN. The network is designed to be scalable, modular, and secure, making it suitable for real enterprise environments.
